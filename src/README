	doc	Documentation.
	log	Log files    (initially empty).

=== How to Install

First, group with your highest level Unix guru, and have him or her tank.
Envy is easier to install than other muds, but every site is different.

(1) Get the release Envy_10.tar.gz from one of these fine
    anonymous ftp sites:

	ferkel.ucsb.edu (most files moved to ftp.tcp.com)
	ftp.math.okstate.edu
	marble.bu.edu
	zen.btc.uwe.ac.uk

(2) Unpack the release.

	gzip -d Envy_10.tar.gz | tar xvf -

(3) Go into the 'src' directory.  Choose the Makefile for your operating
    system and copy it into 'Makefile':

	Makefile	Most machines with 'gcc'
	Makefile.aix	AIX
	Makefile.hp	Hp/UX
	Makefile.irx	Most machines running IRIX
	Makefile.mip	Mips Risc/OS
	Makefile.nex	NeXT
	Makefile.sol	SunSoft Solaris 2.1
	Makefile.sys	Sequent SysV
	Makefile.tek	Tektronix xd88s

    See 'port.txt' for more information on porting, including the
    single-user MsDos and Macintosh versions.

(4) Run 'make' with the following options:

	make -k >&! make.out

    This will take 10 minutes to 60 minutes, depending on the speed of your
    computer.

    If you encounter errors with 'make', send us your 'make.out' file:

	mail -s make.out michael@uclink.berkeley.edu < make.out

    Also we'll need to know what kind of hardware, operating system,
    and C compiler you have.

    We will help you get Envy running, but obviously we can't guarantee
    Envy will run on any particular machine.

(5) Start the game:

	startup &
	telnet localhost 4000
	
(6) To make your first immortal character, just start as a mortal
    character, play at least as far as level 2, and then edit the
    player file and change your level.  (After the first immortal,
    you can advance the rest).

(7) If you haven't already done so, read 'license.doc', 'license.txt',
    and 'license.nvy'.  Because Envy is a derivative work of Diku Mud, you
    must register your mud with the original Diku implementors.
  
(8) Of course you're going to change the title screen, help files, and so on.
    Don't just globally erase the 'Merc' references, ok?  You wouldn't
    like it if we did that to your work, so don't do it to ours.



=== Support

First, read the documentation in the 'doc' directory.  We updated all of the
documentation files from MERC 2.2 for the Envy 1.0 release, and have been
keeping them up-to-date since.

Also check the 'wizhelp' command and read the 'help' descriptions for the
individual immortal commands.

(Immortal commands are considered Skills now and must be edited into
 playerfiles manually.  See 'pfile.txt' for more details)

We have a mailing list, at 'merc@kpc.com'.  Send mail to 'merc-request@kpc.com'
to join the list.

You can write to us directly at the e-mail addresses at the top of this
document.

When you write us, we need to know what kind of machine you're running on.  If
you can give us specific information about the problem, that helps too.

Specific information means: an adb or gdb stack trace (if you're reporting a
crash), or a syslog with the relevant commands logged.  The player files are
ascii files -- dump them into your mail message too.

If your e-mail is too vague, we're likely to bounce it back.  There are two
of us and hundreds of you -- we simply can't engage in long-distance debugging,
on unknown platforms, with the added factor of more code that you've dropped in
since the release.



=== Future Plans

Envy 1.0 is one of the first of platforms created to go beyond the original
limitations of Merc Muds.  Envy 1.0 is a compiliation of bug fixes, new code
and general improvements over the Merc 2.2 release code.

Enjoy.
