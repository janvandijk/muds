This file gives instructions on how to create a time.txt file suitable to
get the mud server to autoshutdown.



=== Time.txt

The time.txt file is simple to create.  With your favorite text editor,
edit a file named time.txt.  In it, you declare the time you wish your
two warnings to go off and when the mud is to shutdown.

The format for the files is such:

WARNINGA
<time:string>~

WARNINGB
<time:string>~

DOWNTIME
<time:string>~


WARNINGA is the time value of the first warning.  WARNINGB is the time value
of the second warning.  DOWNTIME is the time at which the mud server is to
shutdown.  You may or may not wish to include any or all three fields.

The time values are in 24 hour time terminated with a '~'.

The mud checks the time every game pulse and compares the string value of the
current time and the warning/down times.  Should they match, the mud will
issue the proper warning or shutdown command.

There is an online command called SSTIME that sets the warnings and downtime
from within the game.  The changes to these values internally will not save
over game reboots.  For more permanent settings, editing the time.txt file is
more desirable.
