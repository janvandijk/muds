=== What's new in Envy 1.0

Many of the changes from Merc 2.2 release to Envy 1.0 were done by the
coding staff of EnvyMud.  A few like do_whois from Kaneda and such were
obtained from the merc mailing list.  See 'contrib.txt' for acknowledgements.

We have kept logs of what we have done here in EnvyMud.  It helps in
backtracking what was done to the code.  It also helps others follow your
steps should you release your code like us.  :)  You might want to do the
