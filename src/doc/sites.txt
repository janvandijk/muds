=== Merc-Based Sites

The following muds are based on Merc code.  The implementors of these muds
add their own changes and features, so don't expect all these muds to look
alike.  Most of them look VERY different!

To the imps who run these muds ... thanks for sharing your computers with
us all!

If you would like to be added to (or removed from) to this list, just e-mail
Furey, Hatchet, or Kahn.
