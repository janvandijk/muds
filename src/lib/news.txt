Recent changes to MERC Mud:

All old chars and equipment have been wiped.

Playtesters: we have your purple potions.  The list is not negotiable;
our decision is final.  We credited everything in BUGS, IDEAS, and even
some TYPOS, as well as e-mail we received.

If you haven't been to Mud school lately, you should.

There is no more rent.  Just save and quit whenever you like.  If you are
outside of town, it will cost you xp to quit.  There is no more free lunch
available by killing your link.  Note that first level chars can not save,
and certain items (such as keys) cannot be saved.

There are no more ATM's, either.

If you go outside the city gates without a recall, and you walk into
a no-exit room, it's your own fault!  No immortal will rescue you.
You'll have to persuade another player to come get you.

We have level restrictions on grouping.  We also have level restrictions
on equipment.

Your initial abilities are now standard, so you won't gain anything by
rolling characters all night.  Abilities can be trained; there are two
trainers in town.

We have an entire list of areas in "help areas" now.

Several players have asked for a "scan" command.  We think that would
unbalance the game and are not going to have one.
