etcher~
The mad etcher~
The mad etcher is sitting here babbling to himself and working on the wall
~
  Quite insane, the mad etcher has been here it seems for decades...
His hair is white; he babbles nonsense to himself; a layer of dust covers
his out of date clothing; and he seems to be working on the same portion of
the wall near the base...oh and he seems quite blind.

      He leers insanely at you ans says 'heh heh what can I do for you
children?  Please dont mind my wife, she is always like that...hello
dear can you make some tea for our company? Oh good! Now sit right down
will you? would you like hot or cold tea? Yes the weather is....'

And on he babbles....

The specteral etchers wife~
The specteral wife of the etcher is very faintly floating here
~
  Yes you can barely make her out...though it almost makes you vomit.
She is missing half her head...the one half is smashed in horribly like
she took a nasty fall. Her one damaged eye hangs on its own. She smiles
insanely at you thru a broken jaw and missing teeth. One hand of hers is
resting on the shoulder of the etcher...her husband.

shredder~
the Shredder~
A Shredder advances towards you, claws clicking menacingly.
~
It is obviously a large creature, but an improbable number of sharp 
blades, claws and edges makes it near impossible to see its actual 
body. It is gleaming, a metallic black, although occasionally a claw or 
blade changes colour for a while, becoming a neon yellow.

feet.

It is a smallish creature, with too many legs to count, obviously 
very fast. It has a multicoloured carapace (looking much like an oil 
slick on a puddle), and bright red pinpoint eyes.

daemon~
the Daemon~
The Daemon looks at you expressionlessly, from the comfort of its
chair (it feels that way, anyway... You can't see its eyes). Then its
attention returns to the screens.
~
It appears to be a vaguely man-shaped (but larger than man-sized!) hole 
in the fabric of reality... looking closely, you can see stars, either 
inside it, or far beyond it...

the Juggernaut~
A Juggernaut a working its way methodically through this area.
~
It is _very_ large, some 10 yds in length, walking on several hundred 
tiny legs. It is metallic-looking, with large spots of corrosion 
marring its angular skin. On its sides are large signs, written in an 
incomprehensible language. On its top, a small eye cluster swivels back 
and forth continually. A number of tentacles sweeps the ground around 
it.

butterfly fly~
the butterfly~
A beautiful, butterfly-like thing is fluttering around here.
~
It is, on closer inspection, not really an animal, but a variable 
number of brightly-coloured, translucent planes of breathtaking beauty 
and delicacy. The planes pulse, waver, sometimes disappear, but are 
always replaced by another. None of the planes move, but through 
continuous replacement, the butterfly does, in random sweeps.

cowboy~
the cowboy~
A hard-eyed cowboy is here, going about his business.
~
He is dressed in jeans, boots, a hat that shades his face so that it
is hard to see, where he's looking. He is walking around purposefully,
as if searching for something, occasionally getting down to one knee,
making strange passes in the air, then picking up pieces of the ground 
that are apparently not so solid now. He is carrying a leather satchel 
over the shoulder, into which he sometimes place some of the pieces. At
his belt hangs a strange, bluish whip
When ne notices your intense scrutiny, he looks at you coldly, until you
are forced to look away.
