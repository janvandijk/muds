=== Log Directory

This directory keeps all your game log files from running startup or startupSH.



=== The logfiles

Each logfile is numbered starting from 1000.log.  The startup script is smart
enough to create the next appropriate logfile should you restart the mud or
crash.

It is advisable to not hold old logfiles for a long period of time to prevent
cluttering your directory with outdated information on gaming sessions.
