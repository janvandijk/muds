=== The src directory

This file gives a brief description of the files in the src directory.

	Makefiles
	source files
	startup scripts
	executable file
	What is new, what is old in the source



=== The Makefiles

Makefile	- Is the generic Makefile for machines with gcc
Makefile.aix	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for AIX Machines
Makefile.hp	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for HPUX Machines
Makefile.irx	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for IRIX Machines
Makefile.mip	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for MIPS Machines
Makefile.nex	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for the NeXT
Makefile.osf	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for the DEC OSF Alpha
Makefile.sol	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for Solaris 2.4
Makefile.std	- Is the generic Makefile for machines with gcc
Makefile.sys	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for the Sequent SysV
Makefile.tek	- Is the Makefile specifically designed for utek Machines

To compile the executable file 'envy', you must first find the appropriate
Makefile for you.  Usually the Makefile provided is adequate.  But if you
match one of the other Makefiles, you would replace the current 'Makefile'
with the Makefile you choose to use.  For example, you are running a
machine running IRIX, so you choose the file 'Makefile.irx'.  You rename
'Makefile.irx' to 'Makefile' replacing it, then type 'make -k >&! a.out'

If you have problems with crypt, add to the NOCRYPT line in your Makefile
-DNOCRYPT.

We do not guarantee each Makefile will work for your system as each
system administrator will modify to his/her liking.  The Makefile are
only to be used as a close guideline for your system.

We extend a hearty thanks to all who have tested Envy source on these
ports.


=== The source files

act_comm.c	- Contains procedures for pc to pc or pc to mud communication
act_info.c	- Contains procedures for information reports for the pc
act_move.c	- Contains procedures for pc/mobile movement around the mud
act_obj.c	- Contains procedures for object manipulation
act_wiz.c	- Contains procedures for immortal commands
comm.c		- Contains procedures for game TCP/IP communications
const.c		- Contains tables used within the game
db.c		- Contains procedures for data file loading
fight.c		- Contains procedures for pc/mob combat
handler.c	- Contains procedures for data element handling
interp.c	- Contains procedures and tables for game user commands
magic.c		- Contains procedures for spells
merc.h		- Contains data types/prototypes/macros used within the game
save.c		- Contains procedures for player/mob file read and write
special.c	- Contains procedures for mobile special abilities
update.c	- Contains procedures for game operation



=== The startup scripts

startup		- Is the startup script for EnvyMud using CSH
startupSH	- Is the startup script for EnvyMud using SH


On most systems, 'startup &' is adequate for you.

If you wish a more indepth logging feature, 'start' will give you that.

The startup script will create a number log file starting from 1000.log in
the log directory.  Should your game crash, and you have enabled core dumps
by setting your 'LIMIT coredumpsize unlimited' (see your system manual for
information on the command LIMIT), you will have a core file with a name
matching the appropriate log file in your src directory.

The startup script will run the executable named envy2.  This will
allow you to compile and test your code without worrying about
touching the running mud.  When you are done testing your testmud,
rename it as envy.new in the src directory and reboot your "real" mud.
The startup script will automatically update your running executable
and backup your old one.

--- Debugging

Get to know the debugger setup in your computer system.  The most well known
are dbx, adb, and gdb.  My favorite is dbx.  All can be accessed by
issuing this command at your computer prompt, 'dbx envy 1000.core'.  The
output is the line of code where the game has crashed.  To gain more
information, you must obtain a stack trace.  (See the system manual for
information on your resident debugger)



=== The executable file

The executable file is created after typing 'make'.  You must first choose
a Makefile best suited for your machine.  See 'port.txt' for more information.

After making, the executable file is named 'envy'.  After renaming it to
'envy2', you may then boot the game by executing the startup script
'startup' or 'startupSH' by typing 'startup &' or 'startupSH &'.

To enter the game, type 'telnet localhost 4000' from your mud account.



=== What is new, what is old

This source is based on the Envy 1.0 release source code.  Some internal
workings have changed and some player visible improvements have been made.
We've been developing the code for the past 18 months with extensive playing.
Unfortunately, there might be bugs we have missed.  If you encounter errors
or bugs, first check your code additions then forward questions to the
mailing list at merc-l@webnexus.com.

All in all, Envy will "feel" like any other MERC mud out there.  Envy is
designed to go beyond the MERC releases and make into reality many
improvements that went undone in the MERC releases.

Envy does not support traditional C compilers.

See 'new.txt' to see a more accurate list of changes done to the code.

See 'next.txt' to see what might be included in the next release.
